Based on the folder structure I provide below, please identify:



I need you to perform a focused audit on the `domain` and `infrastructure` folders below.

**Primary Goal:** Analyze the structure and then, upon my confirmation, refactor it to align with our established Clean Architecture rules.

**1. Analysis Phase:**
Based on the file structure provided, identify and report on the following in a concise, actionable list:

*   **Violations of instructions or dependency rule.
*   **Misplaced Files:** Pinpoint any files that are in the wrong layer.
*   **Redundancy:** Identify any redundant files or folders that can be consolidated or removed.

For each point in your list, briefly explain **WHAT** the issue is and **WHY** it's a problem.

**2. Confirmation Phase:**
After presenting your analysis, you MUST ask for my explicit confirmation (e.g., "Do you want me to proceed with these changes?") before taking any action.

**3. Action Phase:**
If I confirm, apply all the recommended changes. This includes:
*   **Moving** misplaced files to their correct layers.
*   **Deleting** redundant files and folder
*   **Refactor** and Improved code if needed

Here is the structure for my domain and infrastructure folders:
lib\features\discovery\domain
lib\features\discovery\infrastructure
